    <h2>About Ammamma</h2>
    <p>
      Ammamma.shop was born from a simple belief: the wisdom of our grandmothers should not fade—it should empower them.
    </p>

    <p>At Ammamma.shop, we bring together elderly women—our ammammas—and enable them to support themselves with dignity by doing what they know best: preparing authentic spice powders rooted in generations of home cooking.
      These spice powders are not experiments or modern interpretations. Each recipe has been carefully documented, preserved, and standardized, ensuring that every batch delivers the same familiar taste, just like it has for decades. Consistency is not an accident here—it is a promise. </p>
      
    <p>Our ammamma groups work in small batches, following traditional processes:

      ingredients are carefully selected and cleaned naturally sun-dried to retain potency stone or slow-ground to preserve aroma and flavor. We do not use preservatives, artificial colors, fillers, or shortcuts. When you buy from Ammamma.shop, you are not just choosing pure, home-style spices—you are directly supporting elderly women, helping them stay independent, respected, and economically active. What reaches your kitchen is more than a spice blend.
It is heritage, care, and purpose—packed with honesty.
